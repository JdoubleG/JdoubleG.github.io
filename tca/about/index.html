                <h1>History of Tufts Climate Action</h1>
                <p>Tufts Climate Action started in 2012 as Tufts Divest for Our Future and soon gained widespread support for divestment. This support was demonstrated through a <a href="https://tuftsdivest.files.wordpress.com/2013/01/a-resolution-divestment-fossil-fuel-passed.pdf">TCU senate resolution</a> (passed 24-1), a <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSdihp8vZXi-gjFLO7yHx8tJKE-EwqtIRyGNEIyvMZds8KdPJw/viewform?usp=sf_link">student petition</a>, a <a href="http://tuftsfacultydivestme.wix.com/facultyfortuftsdivestment#!get_involved/c8k2">faculty petition</a>, and a student referendum vote in which 74% voted in favor of divestment. In spring 2013, President Monaco established a working group made of students, faculty, administrators and trustees, led by the chair of the Investment Committee, to consider divestment. In spring 2014, President Monaco <a href="http://president.tufts.edu/blog/2014/02/12/statement-on-divestment-from-fossil-fuel-companies/">announced that Tufts should not divest</a> at that time, citing the fiduciary responsibilities of the university. In fall 2014, Tufts Divest for Our Future was renamed Tufts Climate Action. In April 2015, more than thirty students and alumni <a href="http://tuftsdaily.com/news/2015/04/22/student-protestors-occupy-presidents-office-demand-divestment/">sat-in President Monaco's office</a> for three days to demand that the university reopen negotiations to reconsider divestment. The sit-in in President Monaco’s office in April 2015 lasted three days and brought the campus’ attention back to the issue of fossil fuel divestment. The administration <a href="http://tuftsdaily.com/news/2015/09/18/tufts-climate-action-students-penalized-for-april-sit-in/">unfairly punished the sit-in participants</a> with probation. As a result of the sit-in, the administration conceded to a <a href="http://tuftsdaily.com/news/2015/04/26/agreement-reached-divestment-sit/">meeting between students, faculty, and administrators</a> to discuss divestment and other institutional efforts to address climate change. That meeting occurred in October 2015 and resulted in the administration agreeing to hold a one-day symposium (scheduled for April 1st, 2016) to address the university’s role in combating climate change. The administration also agreed to organize a meeting between the president of the <a href="http://tuftsdaily.com/opinion/2016/03/03/tca-op-ed/">Rockefeller Brothers Fund</a>, a philanthropic fund based on the wealth from Standard Oil that has been divesting from fossil fuels since 2014.</p>
