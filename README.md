This is my personal website, Version 2.10
=========================================

This website is designed with a functional minimalistic design that is intended
to retain stylish form while not sacrificing functionality. It is static HTML
and CSS page.

A note on the images used to facilitate links to external websites: these images
were taken from the Twitter profiles of each of the companies and modified by me
to fit the color scheme of my website. I do not take ownership of any of these
designs and am only responsible for the recoloring of the logos. I acknowledge
that all rights pertaining to these images belong to the respective company.

## As of 12/23/2021 (v2.10):
New job, new city ;) Changed occurrences of "software developer" to "software
engineer".

## As of 12/23/2021 (v2.9):
Updated home page and site headers. Rewritten "About" page content. Internet of
Things project added to "Projects"; project list reordered. Tweaks to the
documentation of the Trident engine check corresponding with Microsoft's switch
to the Chromium engine, which displays this website fine. Shorter LinkedIn link
used.

## As of 10/10/2020 (v2.8):
A new handout is linked in the "Projects" page with information about my
intern project with Amazon. Hyperlinks for the page you are already on no longer
reload the page. Pressing "c" on the "Contact" page no longer reloads the page.
Line endings converted to LF.

## As of 7/6/2020 (v2.7.1):
Updates to the contents of the "Projects" page.

## As of 6/9/2020 (v2.7):
Another update to the contents of the pages to make them more inline with my
life. Changes are primarily centered around the "Home" and "About" pages.

## As of 7/6/2019 (v2.6):
Updates the content of the "About" and "Projects" pages in for both English and
Spanish pages to be up-to-date with my life.

## As of 11/26/2018 (v2.5):
Adds the `files` folder to host files and removes the temporary hosting of the
in-progress Tufts Climate Action website. Sets links on [es.JamesGG.net](http://es.jamesgg.net)
to open in new tabs.

## As of 8/23/2018 (v2.4):
Adapts links to open in new windows/tabs.

Cleans up some documentation in the code because professionalism, folks.

## As of 6/8/2018 (v2.1):
The Spanish version of [es.JamesGG.net](http://es.jamesgg.net) is now live!

## As of 5/28/2018 (v2.0):
Ties in all the new updates since Version 1.0 and adds a new animated and more
user-friendly menu bar. Completes the "About" page. Some stylistic adjustments
have also been made. [JamesGG.net](http://jamesgg.net) now also uses the default
GitHub Pages 404 page instead of the incorrectly set-up (albeit awesome) custom
page.

## As of 5/24/2018 (v1.3):

Lays down the initial framework for the upcoming Spanish translation of
[JamesGG.net](http://jamesgg.net), [es.JamesGG.net](http://es.jamesgg.net), or
maybe just [JamesGG.net/es](http://jamesgg.net/es) -- that much has not been
decided yet. Also updates the projects page to include new things I've worked on
recently and adds an alert message for users of Internet Explorer and Edge
(these browsers do not display page elements correctly with consistency).

## As of 5/20/2018 (v1.2):

Fixed the hotkey JavaScripting. [JamesGG.net](http://jamesgg.net) now has
keyboard navigation support! Also improves documentation.

Added native "Contact" page. Fixed various minor documentation issues.

## As of 1/1/2018 (v1.0):

section to a well-styled web page.
* A PDF handout/web page describing my efforts at the CABCS may be developed.
