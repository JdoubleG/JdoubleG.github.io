This is my personal website, Version 1.2
========================================

This website is designed with a functional minimalistic design that is intended
to retain stylish form while not sacrificing functionality.

A note on the images used to facilitate links to external websites: these images
were taken from the Twitter profiles of each of the companies and modified by me
to fit the color scheme of my website. I do not take ownership of any of these
designs and am only responsible for the recoloring of the logos. I acknowledge
that all rights pertaining to these images belong to the respective company.
