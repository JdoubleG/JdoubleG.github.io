This is my personal website, Version 1.3
========================================

This website is designed with a functional minimalistic design that is intended
to retain stylish form while not sacrificing functionality.

A note on the images used to facilitate links to external websites: these images
were taken from the Twitter profiles of each of the companies and modified by me
to fit the color scheme of my website. I do not take ownership of any of these
designs and am only responsible for the recoloring of the logos. I acknowledge
that all rights pertaining to these images belong to the respective company.

## As of 5/24/2018 (v1.3):

Lays down the initial framework for the upcoming Spanish translation of
[JamesGG.net](http://jamesgg.net), [es.JamesGG.net](http://jamesgg.net/es), or
maybe just [JamesGG.net/es] -- that much has not been decided yet. Also updates
the projects page to include new things I've worked on recently and adds an
alert message for users of Internet Explorer and Edge (these browsers do not
display page elements correctly with consistency).

## As of 5/20/2018 (v1.2):

Fixed the hotkey JavaScripting. [JamesGG.net](http://jamesgg.net) now has
keyboard navigation support! Also improves documentation.

## As of 5/20/2018 (v1.1):

Added native "Contact" page. Fixed various minor documentation issues.

## As of 1/1/2018 (v1.0):

Added "Projects" and "Links" pages. This is the first "non-beta" release of my
website.

## As of 12/31/2017 (v0.2):

Fixed various appearance bugs. Added "About" page.

## As of 12/30/2017 (v0.1):

Added an initial design of the homepage.

## For the future:

In future revisions, the menu bar will be animated and additional content will
be added.
