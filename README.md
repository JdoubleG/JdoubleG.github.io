This is my personal website Version 1.0
=======================================

This website is designed with a functional minimalistic design that is intended
to retain stylish form while not sacrificing functionality.

A note on the images used to facilitate links to external websites: these images
were taken from the Twitter profiles of each of the companies and modified by me
to fit the color scheme of my website. I do not take ownership of any of these
designs and am only responsible for the recoloring of the logos. I acknowledge
that all rights pertaining to these images belong to the respective company.


## As of 1/1/2018 (v1.0):

Added "Projects" and "Links" pages. This is the first "non-beta" release of my
website.

## As of 12/31/2017 (v0.2):

Fixed various appearance bugs. Added "About" page.

## As of 12/30/2017 (v0.1):

Added an initial design of the homepage.

## For the future:

In future revisions, the menu bar will be animated and there will be functional
hotkey navigation.
