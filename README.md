This is my personal website. It is under construction.
======================================================

## As of 12/30/2017L

In the most recent push to the master branch, I have added an initial design of
the homepage. This is intended to be a minimalist and functional design.

## For the future:

In future revisions, the "About," "Projects," and "Links" pages will be
completed to a similar design. The animation of the menu bar and functional
hotkeys will also be added in future revisions.

## Files in this project:

    * `index.html`: this is the homepage.
    * `README.md`:  this file -- information regarding the project.
